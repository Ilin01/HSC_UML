# DR1 Results

The catalogues in this directory were used to produce the figures in [***Martin 2019b***](https://address_temp "arXiv...").

* The catalogue ["average_cluster_properties_HSC_DR1_UDEEP.csv"](https://github.com/garrethmartin/HSC_UML/blob/master/DR1_results/average_cluster_properties_HSC_DR1_UDEEP.csv "cluster properties catalogue") gives the average properties of the objects in each group (Fig B1 in the paper).

* The catalogue ["object_catalogue_HSC_DR1_UDEEP.csv"](https://github.com/garrethmartin/HSC_UML/blob/master/DR1_results/object_catalogue_HSC_DR1_UDEEP.csv "obkect catalogue") gives the centroids of each object, their matching HSC DR1 ID (if matched), and the number of the group that they are a member of (between 0 and 159).
