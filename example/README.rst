**Running the example script**
=====================================================

*First, make sure that you have added your HSC-SSP username and password to the top of ``example_run.py``

*Now run ``python example_run.py``, it will download the images and perform the classification and output a montage of classified images

*TODO include code to explicitly produce more useful outputs
